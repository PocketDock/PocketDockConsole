PocketDockConsole -- *Because RCON was so retro*
=================

##What does this plugin do?
- Allows server admins to have a quick and easy way to administer their servers without the need for RCON
- Gives admins the ability to manage their server from a familiar interface that they can access with ANY web browser (at least ones that have WebSockets)
- Remove the need for other administration tools (you can see everything)
- Give admins a way to have trusted users administer the server as if they were sitting at the console

###PocketDockConsole is a plugin for PocketMine-MP with the following initiatives:
- [x] Allow people to manage their servers quickly and easily
- [x] Show the power of both PocketMine (and PHP)
- [ ] Get people to make more awesome plugins
- [x] Have some fun

##How do I use this awesome plugin?
1. Download the Phar file from either GitHub releases or the PocketMine Forums
2. Drop it into your plugins/ folder
3. Restart the server
4. Edit the password and port in the config (password is important, the port can be left the same)
5. Have fun!
